## Linking

On each page load the random number generator is seeded by the current timestamp (which is printed to the developer console).

To link to a specific map, you can pass the seed in the URL hash:

- Small map: [#1592759118928](https://edwardcunningham.github.io/randomroads/#1592759118928)
- Large map: [#1589058113269](https://edwardcunningham.github.io/randomroads/#1589058113269)
- Massive map: [#1589058320482](https://edwardcunningham.github.io/randomroads/#1589058320482)
